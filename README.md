# About

This is the website for the [Cantaloupe image
server](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/).

The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). With that
installed, run `jekyll serve` from the root repo directory. Then, open
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in a web browser.
