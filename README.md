# About

This is the website for the [Cantaloupe image
server](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/).

The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). With that
installed, run `jekyll serve` from the root repo directory. Then, open
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in a web browser.

# Branching

This repository uses the
[Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
branching model:

1. Work-in-progress for the next major or minor release occurs on the
   `develop` branch.
2. `develop` branches off into `release/n.n` around release time.
3. `release/n.n` is merged into `master`, which is what appears on the
   website.
