<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The delegate system enables the use of custom code to customize the image server's behavior. It can be utilized in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#Delegate%20Script">Using the Ruby delegate script.</a> This method is designed for ease of use. The language in which the script code is written&mdash;Ruby&mdash;is easy to work with, and only a small amount of code is needed to support most use cases.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Java%20Delegate">Using a Java delegate.</a> This is an alternative to the delegate script for users who require the fastest possible startup time, or are more comfortable with Java than Ruby.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Delegate%20Script">Delegate Script</h2>

<p>The delegate script is a file containing a delegate class written in Ruby. The class is instantiated per-request, early in the request cycle, and disposed of at the end of the request cycle. At various points in the request cycle, its methods are called by the application to obtain information needed to service the request.</p>

<p>Before any other methods are called, the application will set the request context, which is a hash of request properties with perhaps some other helpful information mixed in. See the documentation of the <var>context</var> attribute (<code>attr_accessor :context</code>) in the sample delegate script file for information about the keys that may be present in the context hash.</p>

<p>You can also use a statement like <code>context.each{ |k,v| puts "#{k}: #{v}" }</code> in any method to print the context to the console.</p>

<p>The delegate script is reloaded whenever the script file changes. Be aware, though, that code that has already been loaded into the JRuby runtime cannot be unloaded. For example, when a class is changed, the new version will replace the old version; but constants within the class cannot be redefined.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i>
  Generally, neither the context, method arguments, nor return values are sanitized or validated. <strong>Be careful to write defensive, injection-safe code.</strong>
</div>

<h3 id="Getting Started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>The delegate script is disabled by default. To enable it, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.jruby.org/download">Download one of the "complete JARs" from the JRuby download page</a>, and save it wherever you like. (Your Cantaloupe root directory will work fine.)</li>
  <li>Copy the sample delegate script, <span class="filename">delegates.rb.sample</span>, included in the distribution, to <span class="filename">delegates.rb</span>.</li>
  <li>Reference it from the <code>delegate_script.pathname</code> configuration option.</li>
  <li>Set <code>delegate_script.enabled</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
  <li>Add the JRuby JAR from above to the classpath in your invocation command. For example:
    <pre>java -cp cantaloupe-<span class="version">5.0</span>.jar:jruby-complete-x.x.x.x.jar -Dcantaloupe.config=... edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.StandaloneEntry</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3 id="Migrating">Migrating</h3>

<h4 id="MigratingFrom41To5">From the 4.1 Script to the 5.0 Script</h4>

<p>In version 5.0, a new method named <code>pre_authorize()</code> was added. In many cases, the <code>authorize()</code> implementation can simply be moved into this new method, unless it contains logic that depends on information read from the underlying source image. See the sample delegate script, as well as the <a href="access-control.html#Delegate%20Script">Access Control</a> section, for more information.</p>

<h4 id="MigratingFrom4To41">From the 4.0 Script to the 4.1 Script</h4>

<p>In version 4.1, the <code>authorized?()</code> and <code>redirect()</code> methods were merged into <code>authorize()</code>. See the documentation in the sample delegate script file for more information.</p>

<h4 id="MigratingFrom3To4">From the 3.x Script to the 4.0 Script</h4>

<p>See the <a href="../4.0/delegate-script.html#Migrating">4.0 user manual</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Gems">Gems</h3>

<p>JRuby can use most Ruby gems, except those that have been built with native extensions. To import a gem, use a <code>require</code> statement:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'mygem'
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>require</code> searches for gems based on the <code>$GEM_PATH</code> environment variable, falling back to <code>$GEM_HOME</code> if that is not defined. If JRuby fails to find your gem, check your <code>$GEM_PATH</code>. If you installed the gem using <code>gem install</code>, check the output of <code>gem env</code> (particularly the "gem paths" section) to see where it might have been installed, and ensure that those locations are present in <code>$GEM_PATH</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Calling Java Code">Calling Java Code</h3>

<p>This example uses <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URLConnection.html">URLConnection</a>, which is part of the JDK, to execute an HTTP request, as an alternative to other examples which use Ruby's Net::HTTP library.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'java'

java_import java.net.HttpURLConnection
java_import java.net.URL
java_import java.io.BufferedReader
java_import java.io.FileNotFoundException
java_import java.io.InputStreamReader
java_import java.util.stream.Collectors

class CustomDelegate
  def do_something
    url = URL.new('http://example.org/')
    conn, is, reader = nil
    begin
      conn = url.openConnection
      conn.setRequestMethod 'GET'
      conn.setReadTimeout 30 * 1000
      conn.connect
      is = conn.getInputStream
      status = conn.getResponseCode

      if status == 200
        content_type = conn.getHeaderField 'Content-Type'
        if content_type.include? 'text/plain'
          reader = BufferedReader.new(InputStreamReader.new(is))
          entity = reader.lines.collect(Collectors.joining("\n"))
          puts entity
        else
          raise IOError, "Unexpected Content-Type: #{content_type}"
        end
      else
        raise IOError, "Unexpected status: #{status}"
      end
    rescue FileNotFoundException => e
      return nil
    rescue => e
      Java::edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.delegate.Logger.error("#{e}", e)
    ensure
      reader&.close
      is&.close
      conn&.disconnect
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The whole JDK is at your fingertips, and there's nothing to stop you from using third-party JARs and accessing their API from JRuby. Be careful, though, as JARs may contain code that conflicts with the application's dependencies&mdash;different versions of the same library, for example.</p>

<h3 id="Improving Efficiency">Improving Efficiency</h3>

<p>Several delegate methods will be called over the course of a single request, and making them as efficient as possible will improve response times. A couple of ways to improve efficiency are:</p>

<h4 id="Sharing Information">Sharing Information</h4>

<p>Some methods may need to do similar work, which may be expensive. To avoid having to do it twice, a useful technique is to cache the first result. So, rather than doing this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def method1(options = {})
    # perform an expensive query and return the result
  end

  def method2(options = {})
    # perform the same expensive query and return the result
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You could do this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def method1(options = {})
    result = perform_expensive_query
  end

  def method2(options = {})
    result = perform_expensive_query
  end

  # Performs an expensive query only once, caching the result.
  def perform_expensive_query
    unless @result
      # perform the query
      @result = ... # save the result in an instance variable
    end
    @result
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h4 id="Connection Pooling">Connection Pooling</h4>

<p>Most HTTP clients maintain an internal connection pool automatically, but JDBC adapters do not. When accessing a database via JDBC, consider using a connection pool to improve performance. As of now, there is no &quot;official&quot; provision for this, but some options include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the built-in HikariCP pool used by JdbcSource and JdbcCache, noting that HikariCP is not part of the delegate script contract and may change or go away at some point (see <a href="https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/cantaloupe/issues/221#issuecomment-398402952">here</a> for an example that may or may not work);</li>
  <li>Supply a third-party connection pooling library as a JAR;</li>
  <li>Write your own connection pool</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Delegate methods may access a logger that writes to the <a href="logging.html#Application%20Log">application log</a>:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'java'

logger = Java::edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.delegate.Logger
logger.trace 'Hello world'
logger.debug 'Hello world'
logger.info 'Hello world'
logger.warn 'Hello world'
logger.error 'Hello world'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Error stack traces may also be logged:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'java'

logger = Java::edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.delegate.Logger

begin
  raise 'Goodbye world'
rescue => e
  logger.error "#{e}", e
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="Testing Delegate Methods">Testing Delegate Methods</h3>

<p>Delegate methods can be tested by creating an instance of the <code>CustomDelegate</code> class, setting its context to be similar to what the application would set it to, and calling a method:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# This file is named `test.rb`, in the same folder as `delegates.rb`
require './delegates'

obj = CustomDelegate.new
obj.context = {
  'identifier' => 'identifier-to-test',
  'client_ip' => '127.0.0.1',
  'request_headers' => ...
}

puts obj.filesystemsource_pathname
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This script can then be run on the command line with a command like: <code>ruby test.rb</code>.</p>

<p class="text-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The <span class="filename">ruby</span> command will normally invoke the standard ("MRI") Ruby interpreter, and not the JRuby interpreter. While they mostly work pretty similar, <strong>gems with platform-native extensions won't work in JRuby</strong>. Consider installing a standalone <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby interpreter</a> and test with that instead. (Something like <a href="http://rvm.io/">RVM</a> can make it easier to switch between different versions of the Ruby interpreter.)</p>

<h2 id="Java Delegate">Java Delegate</h2>

<p>The Java delegate system was introduced in version 5.0. It relies on a delegate class that is very similar to the one used in the <a href="#Delegate%20Script">delegate script system</a>, but instead written in Java (or some other JVM language), compiled, and packed into a JAR file. Cantaloupe relies on the JDK's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">ServiceLoader</a> to auto-discover the delegate class and then instantiate and use it in the same way the Ruby version is used.</p>

<p>Unlike the delegate script, a sample Java delegate is not bundled with the application. Instead, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/sample-java-delegate">sample Java delegate</a>, which provides a minimal working example.</p>
